### Problem Statement

We need to enhance our FAQs screen by making the FAQ cards both collapsible and deletable, with the exception of the last remaining FAQ card, which should not be deletable.

Although the FAQ cards have been implemented, they are not functioning as intended. To resolve this, we have two specific tasks:

To make it work, we have two requirements

**TASK 1**: Clicking +/- button on card should expand/collapse it
**TASK 2**: Clicking X button on card should delete it

### Visual Reference:

To help you understand the desired functionality, please refer to the following video demonstration of the FAQ card behavior:

## Submission Instructions

1. Clicking "Run code" will compile and run your code against sample tests, but it will not generate scores. Click on "Execution Log" to better understand the test execution.
2. Clicking "Submit code" will run your code against multiple test cases, assessing different scenarios holistically. The score will be assigned accordingly.

To access the instructions, click on the "Question" button which can be found in the bottom left corner of the screen.
